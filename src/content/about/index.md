I'm a software engineer working from India. Welcome to my corner on the web where I share my thoughts on software engineering, design, books, and other interesting stuff. Most of the posts here are guides and tutorials that document a concept or process. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback.

## Random facts

- I work on an Aerospace product where I build microservices and enterprise API. Before this, I worked as a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/) and as an <abbr title="Extract Transform Load">ETL</abbr> consultant for [Suncorp](https://www.suncorp.com.au/).
- I like solving problems and exploring ideas. I work in small bursts. For details about my technical experience, take a look at the [stacktrace](/stacktrace/).
- I read a lot of science fiction, fantasy, manga and poetry.

## About this site

- Originally, I built this site with [Gridsome](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome) to learn [Vue 2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
- In 2022, I reworked it using [Lume](https://lume.land/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). Here are [launch notes](/post/2022/07/13/microflash-version-2/).
- In 2023, I rebuilt it using [Astro](https://astro.build). Here are [launch notes](/post/2023/02/02/introducing-naiyer-dev/).

Building a personal site made me 

- aware of the web community
- inspired me to contribute to the open source, and 
- taught me valuable lessons on accessibility, web performance, typography, design, and more. 

It also spurred my networking with people from different backgrounds.

## All code is _compromise_

## The _stack_

It's fashionable to build personal sites and talk about their stack. I got this asked many times so here’s the _stack_ of this site.

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): the framework that generates this site
- [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) & [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype): the markdown and HTML processors
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/): the library that powers the search
- [Starry Night](https://github.com/wooorm/starry-night): the library that powers the syntax highlighting of the code
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono): the body and `monospace` typefaces
- [Vale](https://vale.sh): the spelling and writing style checker

I'm not using any frontend frameworks. It's the boring (but reliable) HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web components running the show.

:::note
You shouldn't get too hung up on the _stack_ or _tools_. Choose something that’s handy, that lets you do your work, and get started. _Getting started_ is crucial.
